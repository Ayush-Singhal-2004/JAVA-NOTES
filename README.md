#Introduction to JAVA :
1. Development of Java language was started in 1991, by a U.S. company Sun MicroSystems.
2. Java is developed by James Gosling.
3. Its first version was released in 1996.
4. Initially java language was names 'Oak', then after it renamed to Java(Java Coffee).

#Features of JAVA :
1. High level language
2. Object Oriented Language
3. Portable programs
4. Class based
5. Java uses the concept of 'Write Once Run Anywhere' (because of Bytecodes)
6. Platform Independent
7. We can handle multiple programs in Java (Multi-Threading)

#Extension of file
- Source code : file_name.java
- Compile using 'javac', it checks syntax and libraries
- Bytecodes : file_name.class
- Bytecodes are archetecture neutral - not in 0's and 1's.
- Java developer needs JDK, libraries, JRE(JVM) for development.
- End user need libraries & JVM from executing application.
- Java can be considered both a compiled and an interpreted language because its source code is first compiled into a binary byte-code. This byte-code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is usually a software-based interpreter.

#Editions of Java software :
1. Java Standard Edition -> Java SE or J2SE
2. Java Enterprise Edition -> Java EE or J2EE
3. Java Micro Edition -> Java ME or J2ME

#Keypoints of JAVA :
1. Java has 50 keywords.
2. In addition java reserves - true, false, null.
3. Java has a extra reserved word 'goto', but we cannot use it in java.
4. Java uses 'Unicode', which includes ASCII and other characters from languages around the world.

#Escape Sequences in JAVA :
1. \n - new line
2. \t - tab
3. \b - backspace

#Datatypes in JAVA(8 primitive datatypes):
1. byte : range -> -128 to +127, memory -> 1 byte
2. short : range -> -32768 to +36767, memory -> 2 bytes
3. int : range -> -2147483648 to +2147483647, memory => 4 bytes
4. long : 8 bytes
5. float : 4 bytes
6. double : 8 bytes
7. boolean : memory -> 1 bit, possible values are 'true' or 'false'
8. char : memory -> 2 bytes

- No unsigned types in java. All number are signed.
