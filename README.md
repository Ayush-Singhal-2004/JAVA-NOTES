#Features of JAVA :
1. High level language
2. Object Oriented Language
3. Portable programs
4. Class based
5. Java uses the concept of 'Write Once Run Anywhere' (because of Bytecodes)
6. Platform Independent
7. We can handle multiple programs in Java (Multi-Threading)

#Extension of file
- Source code : file_name.java
- Compile using 'javac', it checks syntax and libraries
- Bytecodes : file_name.class
- Bytecodes are archetecture neutral - not in 0's and 1's.
- Java developer needs JDK, libraries, JRE(JVM) for development.
- End user need libraries & JVM from executing application.
- Java can be considered both a compiled and an interpreted language because its source code is first compiled into a binary byte-code. This byte-code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is usually a software-based interpreter.
